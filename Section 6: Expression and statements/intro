about Expressions, Statements, Code Blocks, and Methods.
These are four really key components of Java. 

What is whitespace?
Whitespace is any extra spacing, horizontally or vertically, placed around Java source code.
It's usually added for human readability purposes.
In Java, all these extra spaces are ignored.


These are:

The Expression – An expression computes to a single value.

The Statement – Statements are stand alone units of work.

And Code Blocks – A code block is a set of zero, one, or more statements, usually grouped together in some way to achieve a single goal.

Methods-A method declares executable code that can be invoked, passing a fixed number of values as arguments.
A method is a way of reducing code duplication.
A method can be executed many times with potentially different results, by passing data to the method in the form of arguments.

What are Parameters and arguments //
Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably by developers.
But technically, a parameter is the definition as shown in the method declaration, and the argument will be the value that's passed to the method when we call it.
